## What is Skrivla?

Skrivla is your self-hostable collaborative editor. Think Google Docs, but specically built for quick brainstorming sessions, meeting notes etc. Just share a link to a page and anyone can collaborate on it.

## Getting started

The easiest way to use Skrivla is to [install it on Luvabase](https://luvabase.com/apps/skrivla/install). On Luvabase authentication is managed for you.

You can also [Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/simonbengtsson/skrivla) and protect your Skrivla instance with [Cloudflare Access](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/secure-with-access).

## Stack

Skrivla is built as a SPA with light server api and persistance layer on Cloudflare Durable Objects.

- Server: Cloudflare Durable Objects and Worker
- Client: Shadcn, tanstack router, vite, tailwind
- Rich text editing with [Tiptap](http://tiptap.dev)

## Contributions

Very much welcome! The goal is to keep editor minimal, but below are some examples of what would be in scope:

- Attachments
- Agent integration in editor (with Workers AI)
- MCP server for finding and reading documents
- A small desktop sync application to sync pages to a local folder for easier access by local agents
- Page pinning or otherways to improve sidebar for many pages
